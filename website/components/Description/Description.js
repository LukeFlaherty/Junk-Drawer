      <h2>What's In The Drawer?</h2>
      <p>
        The Junk Drawer is a creation by Luke and Jake Flaherty that uses a
        Google Chrome Extension to take a screenshot of the page you are
        currently on. With this screenshot, which we have labelled "junk" we
        will store it in a massive gallery, or "junk drawer."
      </p>
      <p>
        You are meant to take screenshots of any page that you deem important or
        helpful. Any screenshot you take is stored in your own personal "drawer"
        with a sharable limk that you can show anyone. This link you can show to
        anyone and they can view what you've stored.
